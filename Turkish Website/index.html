        <h1>Turkish Table Manners & Hospitality</h1>
        <p>Turkey is known for its warm hospitality and strong dining etiquette. Whether you're invited to a local’s home or dining at a restaurant, it’s important to understand and respect Turkish table manners.</p>

        <h2>1. Greetings & Seating</h2>
        <p>When arriving at a Turkish home, greet your host warmly. Wait for them to show you where to sit.</p>

        <h2>2. Shoes Off Indoors</h2>
        <p>It is customary to remove your shoes before entering a home. Some hosts may provide indoor slippers.</p>

        <h2>3. Respect for Elders</h2>
        <p>Elders are served first. Always wait for the host or eldest person to start eating before you begin.</p>

        <h2>4. Using Cutlery & Hands</h2>
        <p>Most dishes are eaten with cutlery, but some traditional foods like kebabs and bread can be eaten by hand.</p>

        <h2>5. Sharing & Generosity</h2>
        <p>Turkish hospitality is generous. Never refuse food too quickly—it may be considered impolite.</p>

        <h2>6. Drinking Etiquette</h2>
        <p>Tea is served after meals. If offered tea, it is polite to accept. When drinking raki (a local alcoholic beverage), toast by making eye contact.</p>

        <h2>7. Paying the Bill</h2>
        <p>In restaurants, it is common for one person to pay for the whole group. If you want to pay, insist firmly.</p>

        <h2>8. Thanking the Host</h2>
        <p>After a meal, thank the host by saying "Ellerinize sağlık" (meaning "Health to your hands").</p>
